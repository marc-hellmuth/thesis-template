# thesis-template

## Requirements

- Every thesis requires a Swedish title and Swedish abstract (_Sammanfattning_).
  - If you write in English, make sure to add Swedish translation!
  - If you write in Swedish, it is nice but not required to add an English title and abstract.

## Advice

- Use a filename like "Firstname_Lastname.tex" on your main report file. This way, you end up with a filename that is personal. Teachers and examiners have loads of files named "report.pdf" or "thesis.pdf". A personal filename helps them.
- Append a date to the PDF you send to your teacher. Most students need a revision or two, so a date in the filename helps keeping submissions apart.
