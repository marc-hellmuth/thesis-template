## Advice

- Use a filename like "Firstname_Lastname.tex" on your main report file. This way, you end up with a filename that is personal. Teachers and examiners have loads of files named "report.pdf" or "thesis.pdf". A personal filename helps them.
- Append a date to the PDF you send to your teacher. Most students need a revision or two, so a date in the filename helps keeping submissions apart.
